I am a graduate student of TU Darmstadt, specializing in Mechatronics (Simulation and Control of Mechatronic Systems) with experience in robotics, control engineering, machine learning (ML) and computer vision.

During many projects in my studies I have gained interest in control engineering and robotics. I have extensive knowledge in Python, C/C++ and ROS (Robot Operating System). In addition, while working as a PHP developer, I was able to improve my web development skills. Through an internship at Opel (trajectory and path planning) as well as a student project (commissioning of an NVIDIA Drive PX 2), I gained insights into the field autonomous driving. During my Master's thesis, I obtained in-depth knowledge in machine learning. With the help of "risk-sensitive reinforcement learning" algorithms a Barrett WAM learned the basics of playing badminton.
